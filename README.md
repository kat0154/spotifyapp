Ever wonder how streamers display what spotify song they're listening to on stream? well here's a thing that does exactly that...



# Step 1, getting the ID and Secret:

Firstly, you're gonna wanna head [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and login

after that, you need to create an app

then BOOM, you have it; i'd reccomend saving these in a text file somewhere for later use

and now we're on to 
# Step 2, initiating the client:

Alright so ive tried to simplify this AS Much AS i Possibly Could for all you peeps okay, though i am really bad at explaining so just try an follow...

Firstly, we're gonna download the file and place the folder on your desktop (it doesn't have to be desktop but thats just the easiest placec to get to it)

Now that's done we run the program, it's gonna ask you for that Client ID first so have that ready to copy-paste

And now it's gonna ask for your Secret, so let's copy paste that as well

Finally it's gonna ask for a bot name, now this does not matter at all, this is just what it'll call itself when it starts working
